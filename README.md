<div style="height: auto">
    <p>I'm currently studying Cyber and Computer Engineering at AAU in Copenhagen. Last year I was studying Computer Science at AU (Aarhus).</p>
    <p>I can write, in descending order of confidence; Rust, C#, Java, Python, Scala, C, JavaScript, and HLSL/ShaderLab.<p>
    <p>Along with programming languages I have a (relatively, not professionally) high amount of experience with the Unity engine, shader/VFX development, game design, Git/SCMs and shells (mostly PowerShell).</p>

    <p>Repositories/projects are generally public by default unless sensitive information is involved. No project should be considered as being under active maintenance.</p>
    <p>One day I might make an actual website instead of just this readme, but that day is not today.</p>
