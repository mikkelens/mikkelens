<div style="height: auto">
    <p>I'm currently a Cyber and Computer Engineering student at AAU in Copenhagen, with some previous experience (previously Computer Science at AU)</p>
    <p>I can program Rust, C#, Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, C, and HLSL/ShaderLab (in order of confidence). Along with programming languages I have a (relatively, not professionally) high amount of experience with the Unity engine, shader and VFX development, game design, Git/SCMs and shells (mostly PowerShell).</p>
    <p>On my profile you'll find the projects I am able to show publicly. Few of my things are meant to be used by other people, I just like being able to share it easily.</p>
