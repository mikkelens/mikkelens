    <p>I'm a CS student at AU's Institute of Computer Science, with a bit of previous experience.</p>
    <p>I can program C#, Rust, Java, Python, HLSL/ShaderLab and JS (in order of confidence). Along with programming languages I have some experience with Unity Engine, shader development, game design, Git/SCMs and shells (mostly PowerShell).</p>
    <p>On my GitHub profile you'll find the projects I am able to show publicly. Very few of my things are meant to be used by other people, I just like having it accessible for anyone who wants to read my source code.</p>
